# goFitReact

##Notes From Meeting w/ Elizabeth?
* Introduce Tabs because layout is confusing 
* Plus botton to add progress is confusing 
* Swipe left and right instead of using arrows to click though 
* Make animations faster 
* Make Progress more dynamic w/ animations so you can be more excited 
* Show “breaks” in progress bar so people can see how much they have left (FitBit uses dots, because they’re easy to count) 
* Blue / green are too bright together, try toning down the brightness. Orange feels random compared to the green and the blue. 
* Be consistent with use of gradient throughout app.
* Show who you’re competing with on the main screen. 
* What’s the Level for? -> elaborate on this feature, make it more flush on the bottom. 
* Use bold fonts to differentiate.
